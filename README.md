# VAERS Data from Zip to JSON

Quick tool to turn [VAERS Zip Files](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html?) into json for further analysis.

Part of a vain effort to demonstrate that you can't just look at a few rows of this data and claim to have discovered some new vaccine danger.

Usage: 

`python3 vaers-to-json.py ~/Downloads/2020VAERSData.zip > output.json`
